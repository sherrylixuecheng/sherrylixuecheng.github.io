## Goal

Equipped the essential knowledge for high-school students to use the cutting-edge AI for protein structure tools and to explore the fantastic protein structures 

## Key tools/knowledge

(1) AP level protein related knowledge

(2) Protein structure visualization tool: PyMOL

(3) PDB databank

(4) AlphaFold 2 database & paper reading

(5) RossetaFold online server (Robeta server) & paper reading

## Final outcome

Every student needs to write a research report to discover and analyze the structures for a specific protein picked by the student using the tools and knowlegde introduced in this class.
