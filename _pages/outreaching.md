## AI4Sci Education 
I think it is equally important to perform the cutting-edge research by myself and to help the growth of next generation of researchers. I'm currently collaborating with PalmDrive Education as a scientic mentor and working closely with talented college students on **AI4Sci** and/or **quantum sciences**. 


Any college students are welcome to work with me on reasonable projects. If you have interests, please contact via [PalmDrive](https://palmdrive.cn) (The application is now closed since I have already had a college student mentee. Please check back in May, 2023) Or direct contact me via sherrylixuecheng@gmail.com


## Opensource software developments
I'm a contributor to an opensource software, [MathTranslate](https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/MathTranslate). This is a project to provide translation of scientific papers with heavy math symbols from any language to any language while keeping the math symbols unchanged. More can be found from [Jiace's personal page](https://susyustc.github.io/mathtranslate/)
