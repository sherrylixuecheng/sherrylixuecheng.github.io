I will join Tencent Quantum Lab in June, 2022 as a research scientist. I earned a PhD degree of theoretical chemistry in California Institute of Technology working with Prof. Thomas F. Miller III in Mar, 2022. I received a Bachelor of Science degree with quadruple majors in Chemistry, Math, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2016.

I am interested in the interdisciplinary research between chemistry, physics, biology, and computer sciences, and passionate about bridging the mind gaps between different areas. My current research focuses on AI for chemistry, including molecular modelling by Molecular Orbital-Based Machine Learning (MOB-ML) method for electronic structure, and nucleic acid secondary structure modelling with machine learning and molecular dynamics tools (INSPIRE).
