**Research**

I will join [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), Department of Chemistry as an Assistant Professor (est. late 2025). Please also see my [group home page](https://ai4qc.github.io/) and our [group GitHub home](https://github.com/AI4QC) for the most update research interests. I'm an Alumni of [Microsoft Research AI4Sci Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/) and [Tencent Quantum Lab](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/)  My work is focusing on AI for science, including quantum chemistry, biology, and quantum computing algorithms. I am interested in the interdisciplinary research between chemistry, physics, biology, and computer sciences, and passionate about bridging the mind gaps between different areas.

I earned a PhD degree of theoretical chemistry in California Institute of Technology working with Prof. Thomas F. Miller III in Mar, 2022. I received a Bachelor of Science degree with quadruple majors in Chemistry, Math, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2016. My PhD research focused on AI for chemistry, including molecular modelling by Molecular Orbital-Based Machine Learning (MOB-ML) method for electronic structure, and nucleic acid secondary structure modelling with machine learning and molecular dynamics tools (INSPIRE).


**AI4Sci Education**

I'm also a part-time educator, scientific mentor, and application advisor for high-school and undergraduate students. For more details, please see the [AI4SciEdu organization](https://ai4sciedu.github.io/), [Teaching](https://sherrylixuecheng.github.io/teaching), and [Outreaching](https://sherrylixuecheng.github.io/outreaching).
