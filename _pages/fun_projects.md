## Outreaching: AI4Sci Education 
I think it is equally important to perform the cutting-edge research by myself and to help the growth of next generation of researchers in the field of AI for science. I'm currently collaborating with PalmDrive Education as a scientic mentor and working closely with talented college students on **AI4Sci** and/or **quantum sciences**. 


Any college students are welcome to work with me on performing reasonable projects in AI4Sci. If you have interests, please contact via [PalmDrive](https://palmdrive.cn).
